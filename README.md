## React/Redux login app
-- WORK IN PROGRESS --
Basic functioning web app (feel free to play with registering/login/logout): https://react-redux-login-836a1.firebaseapp.com/

Test app for login components built using React and Hooks.

I previously built a login app based on 'codedamn' Youtube video 'Firebase + React HOOKS Authentication tutorial' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_wZCW6wXIo). This app is my own version, building upon what I learned but changing it to suit my preferred coding style and to incorporate a Redux store into the app.

If you're using this code, to activate it, a Firebase project needs to be setup and the appropriate config info copied into firebase.js and the Firebase authentication method 'email and password' must be enabled
